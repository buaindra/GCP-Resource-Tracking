# GCP-Resource-Tracking
This repo I am creating, to easily track the GCP Resources. It can be project details, VMs, Bucket details, Bigquery tables etc.


#Step by step process to track the GCP Resource Tracking
1. Connect with the CloudShell from your GCP Console
2. Authorize the cloudshell to perform/execute the script: (run $gcloud auth list, it will ask for the authorization)
3. Download the script file from GIT: 
4. Then, execute the bash script:
5. Wait for sometime, you will get message that, 1 output_mm_dd_yyyy.csv file.
6. Open the file via nano, vim editor or download from cloudshell machine.
